    mc_inner "The pilot academy is only place in the world to study and learn how to operate Mechatron, an all-powerful mobile suits powered with magic"
    mc_inner "Of course, because it is powered with magic, only a magic user can use it. But, it can run for short time with internal magic reserve too"
    mc_inner "And this humble 7, of course is the Mechanic of those Magnificent Mechatrons"
    mc_inner "Only an apprentice though..."

    mc "You got what youre coming for huh?  That punch marks sure looks like a kiss mark"
    flashyGuy "Oh, brother, if only it was a soft one and not from a flat monster i’d be thrilled"
    mc_inner "This womanizing failure is my best friend, Fernando or Nando. Even though he is an ace pilot and italian, a trait that every guy will die for, he still can’t get a date for some reason."
    mc "Speaking of which, your Mechatron maintainance is almost done, come to school’s workshop in lunch break.  I also added some amazing tweaks"
    nando "Mio diavolo compagno! You are the best, seven. I really can’t trust my machine to anyone else than you. You are truly the Pilot Academy’s genius mechanic"
    mc "Geez, you’re exaggerating. Any other mechanic will do the same. Hey, isn’t that the bell?"
    nando "Oh no! I will be late for the homeroom. Catch you later, mio amico!"
    mc_inner "Dont run into any women in the hall though..."
    mc_inner "The pilot candidates are already in their class, it might be time for me to go to the workshop.."

    #Workshop (BGM: work day)
    bob "...the maintainance for the ships will be handled by team, and Bolivia’s Mechatron needs an extra shoulder barrel gun, we will also include that into today’s work, any question?"
    mechanics "Sir no sir!"
    bob "Then get back to work!"
    mechanics "Yes sir!"
    mc_inner "Its another day in the workshop again. Uncle Bob giving commands as always to the mechanics, metallic sounds heard. It truly is a work day."
    bob "Seven"
    mc "Yes uncle?"
    bob "How was the Italian Mechatron coming along?"
    mc "The maintainance almost finished, i also installed some tweaks and change the cockpit interior to make the pilot more comfy"
    bob "Honestly, i expect less because it is your first solo maintainance... If it’s not for the candidate request to be personally fixed up to you, i won’t give it for you to repair"

    #Smiling 
    bob "But you’re doing your best as always, that’s a great job"
    mc "You’re overcomplimenting me, uncle"
    bob "Eh, i think it was right though? For the boy that’s regarded by people and his peers this workshop genius mechanic, it was even less than a compliment"
    mc "Then if im such a genius... Will you raise my allowance?"

    #*sharp gaze
    bob "No"
    mc_inner "Failed again... It was such a befitting atmosphere though"
    bob "Maybe if you’re achieve more i would think it over sometimes.. Now get back to work"
    mc_inner "Did he say ‘think it’ and ‘sometimes’ ?  This stingy uncle of mine..."
    mc "Yes sir!"
    mc_inner "I found myself back into a mountain of machinery"
    mc "This part will go into this slot, and for the internal supply..."
    mc_inner "Handling Mechanics is my passion. Especially Mechatron.  I find tweaking gears, building, making parts and maintaining them as a hobby for myself. I believe, this is the perfect job for me."
    mc "Let’s add the pilot personal data... and Voila!"
    mc_inner "Nando’s Mechatron, Zephyros is Online. It has green-yellow colour, it’s head are pointy as to reduce air resistance in mid-air flight. This Mechatron is a High-Speed, Assault Mechatron."
    mc "That guy’s gonna be thrilled when he got here, I’ve done my best to his personal Mechatron."
    mc_inner "Somehow, i felt a sense of accomplishment. It’s my first solo maintainance after all."
